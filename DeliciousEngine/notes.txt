Angelscript vs Lua vs Python vs ChaiScript

AngelScript seems similar to C / C++, but is slower...
Lua is probably the fastest, with LuaJIT too. But the API is C-like and really old...
Python seems a nice choice but seems like a pain to integrate.
ChaiScript is looking nicer and nicer with a modern syntax and easy C++ binding...
