Angelscript vs Lua vs Python vs ChaiScript

AngelScript seems similar to C / C++, but is slower...
Lua is probably the fastest, with LuaJIT too. But the API is C-like and really old...
Python seems a nice choice but seems like a pain to integrate.
ChaiScript is looking nicer and nicer with a modern syntax and easy C++ binding...

Reloading C++ .dlls? Have to recompile if you change data structures or other major changes...

Hotloading resources:
	-sounds
	-meshes
	-textures
	-shaders
...Do I actually need to hotload assets if scripts are potentially loading them
at runtime anyway? Perhaps only use hotloading when strictly programming with C++
(Rather than a scripting language)

Custom extension workflows:
	-"FileLoaders"?
	-script extensions

Framerate/Timing:
	-FPS cap?
	-Vsync?
	-Determinism?
	-Different "timelines"
	-Delta time?
	-Physics time?
	-Fixed time updates?

Skinned animation? FBX? other animation formats?

User-accessible GUI?

Use std::function instead of function pointers to avoid global/static console commands,
can make console commands actually part of an object...
